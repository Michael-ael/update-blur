You can start a Nutmeg personal pension with just £500 and transfer in your personal pensions from other providers so you can have all your investments in one easy-to-use online account. Log in whenever you want to see where your pension pot is invested and how it’s performing. Fully managed, socially responsible and fixed allocation pension portfolios are available.

These restrictions may prevent an individual holding certain securities, enforce a minimum holding period, restrict trading periods, force the sale of a security and so on.\r\nGenerally, discretionary investment accounts — like Nutmeg — are exempt from these rules as the decisions about which underlying securities to invest in are made by the investment manager, not the individual. This generally has the effect of making your investment choice greater and your life easier, as you may no longer need to seek approval from your employer for any investment transactions made by Nutmeg. This does of course depend on the personal account dealing rules to which you are subject and not all employers have the same requirements.\r\nIf you are subject to personal account dealing rules we can provide a confirmation letter for your employer's HR or compliance department regarding the discretionary managed nature of Nutmeg's services. Request the letter by contacting us at support@nutmeg.com or send us a Nutmail once signed in.\"\r\n    }\r\n  },{\r\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\r\n    \"name\": \"Do you give advice?\",\r\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\r\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\r\n      \"text\": \"Yes. Based on what you tell us about your finances and plans, we will help you to determine the Nutmeg portfolio that is right for you. Once we agree on what that should look like, we will set up the portfolio for you, and adjust how it is invested on an ongoing basis so that your portfolio remains right for your goals. Nutmeg is a discretionary investment manager, which means that we take responsibility for the investment decision making and transactions.\r\nIf you want us to, we will arrange the transfer of any existing investments such as ISAs or pensions that you want to add to your portfolio.\r\nOnce you have taken the decision to invest with Nutmeg, our investment team makes decisions to buy and sell your investments on your behalf, always bearing in mind your objectives and risk tolerance. You do not have to give your consent for every transaction; instead, you agree that we’ll take responsibility for your investments when you accept our Terms and Conditions. In these terms, we promise to manage your account with skill, care and in accordance with the information you give us. We’ll spend every moment of the day trying our best to protect and grow your portfolio.\r\nWe have permission from our regulator to give you simplified advice—see our definitions or the FCA website. We started offering advice through the online service from 6th June 2016.\r\nIf you would like personal financial advice, please visit our advice page.\"\r\n    }\r\n  },{\r\n    \"@type\":
