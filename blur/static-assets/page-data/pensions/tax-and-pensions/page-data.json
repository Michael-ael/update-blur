It’s important that you understand the potential impacts of salary sacrifice, how they link with employment law, and how they may affect your future, before deciding to enter into a salary sacrifice arrangement.\r\nClaiming tax relief on pension contributions for previous years\r\nIf you don’t get your tax relief automatically or you’re a high earner and didn’t claim your extra entitlement to tax relief, you’re able to back-date tax relief claims for the previous four years.
