This means you can get a total of £3,000 from the government.\nWhat’s more, if you’re planning to buy a home with someone else, you can each open a Help to Buy ISA – meaning that you could get up to £6,000 from the government to put towards your first home.Help to Buy ISAs can be used for homes costing up to £450,000 in London and £250,000 outside London. If you’d like to buy a property outside London for more than £250,000, the Lifetime ISA might be a better option for you.The Innovative Finance ISAThe Innovative Finance ISA is a peer-to-peer (P2P) investment wrapped up in an ISA. So you’re able to invest in peer-to-peer lending platforms without paying capital gains tax on your returns.If you invest in P2P lending you may get a better interest rate than through a high street bank savings account. But the risks are greater, too. If the ‘peer’ you lend to doesn’t perform as expected, you could bear the brunt of any losses, and those losses are final if they default on a payment.Liquidity can also be an issue if you want to withdraw your money before the end of the term of the loans you’ve made.Innovative Finance ISAs aren’t currently backed by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), so you may want to approach these ISAs with caution.The Junior ISA (JISA)A Junior ISA is a way to start building up savings for children as early as possible. All children resident in the UK can have one. A parent or legal guardian can open it on the child’s behalf; 16-year-olds can open a Junior ISA for themselves. Anyone, including grandparents, aunts and uncles can add money to a Junior ISA (However, at Nutmeg only the registered contact can contribute.) Once the child turns 18, the Junior ISA automatically converts to an adult ISA.You can transfer an existing child trust fund (CTF), for which investments are made in cash, into a Junior ISA. As with their adult counterparts, Junior ISAs are tax efficient. You can open a Junior stocks and shares ISA or a Junior cash ISA.The Junior ISA allowance for the 2021/22 tax year is £9,000.\"    }  },{    \"@type\": \"Question\",    \"name\": \"What is ISA flexibility?\",    \"acceptedAnswer\": {      \"@type\": \"Answer\",      \"text\": \"ISA flexibility refers to whether you’re able to withdraw from your ISA without affecting your annual allowance. If an ISA is flexible, you can withdraw \nmoney from it and then put money back into it, within the same tax year, without affecting your annual ISA allowance. It applies to money deposited in the ISA in previous years as well as money you’ve contributed in the current tax year.Let’s look at an example:You have £35,000 in a flexible cash ISA. This is made up of £25,000 from previous tax years and £10,000 that you’ve contributed during this tax year. The current ISA allowance is £20,000 per tax year, which means you still have £10,000 of your allowance remaining. You decide to withdraw £15,000. Because it’s a flexible ISA, you’re still able to contribute a further £25,000 in the current tax year – this is made up of the £15,000 you took out and the £10,000 remaining of your annual year allowance.If an ISA is not flexible it means that if you withdraw money, that part of your annual allowance remains used. So, if you had already reached the ISA allowance limit and then decided to take money out, you would not be able to put the money back into an ISA within that tax year.Flexible ISAs are normally cash ISAs, but not all providers offer flexible cash ISAs. However, cash ISAs are not the only ISA types that offer flexibility – depending on the provider, you may be able to get flexibility within an Innovative Finance ISA and for the cash held within a stocks and shares ISA. Flexibility is not available for Lifetime ISAs and Junior ISAs. Make sure you check with your provider to ensure your ISA meets your needs. Nutmeg does not offer flexible ISAs.\"    }  },{    \"@type\": \"Question\",    \"name\": \"Who can open an ISA?\",    \"acceptedAnswer\": {      \"@type\": \"Answer\",      \"text\": \"To open an ISA, you have to be a UK resident for tax purposes. You can only open an ISA for yourself and not with, or on behalf, of someone else - except in the case of a Junior ISA.Specific ISAs have different restrictions in terms of how old you need to be to open one. You have to be:16 or older to open cash ISA18 or older to open a stocks and shares ISA or an Innovative Finance ISAbetween 18 and 39 years old to open a Lifetime ISAbetween 16 and 18 years old to open a Junior ISA for yourself18 or older to open a Junior ISA for a child, assuming you’re the child’s parent or legal guardian.\"    }  },{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",    \"name\": \"What is the difference between an ISA and a savings account?\",    \"acceptedAnswer\": {      \"@type\": \"Answer\",      \"text\": \"There are a few differences between an ISA and a savings account that are worth knowing.The biggest differences between a regular savings account and an ISA are:Savings accounts generally don’t have an annual contribution limit, whereas ISAs have a government-specified annual allowance.With regular savings accounts, you save your money as cash; if you open an ISA, you can choose to save in cash, invest in stocks and shares, or invest in peer-to-peer lending.Depending on your personal circumstances and income tax rate, you’ll have to pay tax on any interest earned in a savings account that is over your personal savings allowance. For an ISA, you never pay tax on any growth, returns or interest earned. The interest earned in an ISA doesn't count towards your personal savings allowance.When you die, ISA allowances can be passed on to your spouse or civil partner more tax efficiently than money in a regular savings account.There are also some similarities between ISAs and savings accounts. For example, both have account types that allow you to access your money easily without paying a penalty fee, and both have account types where you can put your money into the account for a fixed amount of time at a certain interest rate.Whether you choose an ISA or a regular savings account, the choices you make around where and how to invest or save money will depend on your personal circumstances, goals, the length of time you want to put your money away for and the level of risk you are willing to take with that money.\"    }  },{    \"@type\": \"Question\",    \"name\": \"How many ISAs can you have?\",    \"acceptedAnswer\": {      \"@type\": \"Answer\",      \"text\": \"You can have as many stocks and shares ISAs, cash ISAs, and Innovative Finance ISAs as you want, but you can only open or contribute to one of each of these types in any one tax year.You can only ever have one Lifetime ISA and one Help to Buy ISA – provided you’re eligible. It’s important to remember that while you can have both a Lifetime ISA and a Help to Buy ISA, you can only use the government bonus from one of them to buy your first home. But you could use the Help to Buy ISA to purchase your first home and then use the Lifetime ISA for retirement and you still could get the government bonuses from both schemes.\nYou can only have one Junior ISA, if you’re under 18. However, if you’re between 16 and 18 years old, you could have a Junior ISA and a cash ISA.You can decide how to use your annual ISA allowance across the different ISA types you’re eligible for. You’re able to split the amount any way you like between the different ISA types across the tax year. However, you can only contribute up to £4,000 into a Lifetime ISA each tax year and remember, you can’t put money into more than one ISA of the same type in the same tax year.Let’s look at an example:Let’s say you already have a stocks and shares ISA, a Lifetime ISA, and a cash ISA.You haven’t yet used any of your £20,000 annual ISA allowance for the 2021/2022 tax year.You decide to put £11,000 into your stocks and shares ISA and £4,000 into the Lifetime ISA. You’d still have £5,000 to use across the tax year. You may decide to open a new cash ISA and contribute a portion of your allowance to that, or to contribute to your already established cash ISA instead. However, you couldn’t open a new cash ISA and pay into both that and your existing cash ISA – you can only pay into one ISA type per year.It’s important to remember that the Junior ISA allowance is separate to the £20,000 ISA allowance. So, if you’re between 16 and 18 years old, you could pay £9,000 into a Junior ISA and still have a £20,000 allowance to contribute to a cash ISA. You can also contribute to someone else’s Junior ISA without affecting your annual allowance.\"    }
